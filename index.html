      <div class="cont">

      <blockquote><em>
        “We don’t get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent. Because this is our life. Life is brief, and then you die, you know? And we’ve all chosen to do this with our lives. So it better be damn good. It better be worth it.”
      </em></blockquote>
      <blockquote><em>
         “I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what’s next.”
      </em></blockquote>
      <blockquote><em>
         "My favorite things in life don't cost any money. It's really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time."
      </em></blockquote>
      <blockquote><em>
         “Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.”
      </em></blockquote>
      <blockquote><em>"Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.”</em></blockquote>
      <blockquote><em>"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."</em></blockquote>.
